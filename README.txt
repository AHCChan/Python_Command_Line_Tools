DESCRIPTION

A number of functions useful for Command Line compatible programs, such as
command line input validators and centrally controlled print statements.



REQUIREMENTS

This program runs in Python 2. It will not work properly with Python 3.

Please ensure you have Python 2 installed on your computer.

Please ensure you are using the correct version of Python to run this program.



INSTRUCTIONS

You don't need to know how to use git to use this program. You can simply open
"_Command_Line_Parser.py" and "_Controlled_Print.py" in your online browser and
copy their contents onto local files on your computer with the same names.

If you need this library to run another program, either paste a copy of
"_Command_Line_Parser.py" and "_Controlled_Print.py" into the same folder as 
the ".py" file of that program, or configure your Python runtime environment so
that it is possible for said program to access "_Command_Line_Parser.py" and 
"_Controlled_Print.py".
